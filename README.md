# Wumpus-C-Game
Wumpus Hunt Game
Wumpus Hunt is my first attempt at developing a C++. It is a grid-based adventure game where players navigate a cave to retrieve gold while avoiding hazards like bats, stalactites, and the Wumpus. The game allows users to set the size of the cave and set a debug mode. The game also features percepts to give hints about nearby hazards

Features
  •	Customizable Game Board: Players can select the size of the cave (up to 50x50).
  •	Random Event Generation: The cave is populated with random events like Wumpus, Gold, Bats, and Stalactites.
  •	Debug Mode: Allows visibility into the locations of events for testing.
  •	Dynamic Wumpus Movement: The Wumpus may relocate during gameplay, increasing difficulty.
  •	Percepts System: Players receive clues based on adjacent rooms to detect nearby events.
  •	Player Controls: Move through the cave and shoot arrows in four directions (up, down, left, right).
  •	Win Conditions: Escape with the gold or kill the Wumpus.
  
Gameplay
  •	Explore the cave using WASD keys to move.
