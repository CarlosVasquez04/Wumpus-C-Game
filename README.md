# Wumpus-C-Game
Wumpus Hunt is my first attempt at developing a C++. It is a grid-based adventure game where players navigate a cave to retrieve gold while avoiding hazards like bats, stalactites, and the Wumpus. The game allows users to set the size of the cave and set a debug mode. The game also features percepts to give hints about nearby hazards.
