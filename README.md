# Wumpus-C-Game
Wumpus Hunt Game
Wumpus Hunt is my first attempt at developing a C++. It is a grid-based adventure game where players navigate a cave to retrieve gold while avoiding hazards like bats, stalactites, and the Wumpus. The game allows users to set the size of the cave and set a debug mode. The game also features percepts to give hints about nearby hazards

Features
  1. 	Customizable Game Board: Players can select the size of the cave (up to 50x50).
  2. 	Random Event Generation: The cave is populated with random events like Wumpus, Gold, Bats, and Stalactites.
  3. 	Debug Mode: Allows visibility into the locations of events for testing.
  4. 	Dynamic Wumpus Movement: The Wumpus may relocate during gameplay, increasing difficulty.
  5. 	Percepts System: Players receive clues based on adjacent rooms to detect nearby events.
  6. 	Player Controls: Move through the cave and shoot arrows in four directions (up, down, left, right).
  7. 	Win Conditions: Escape with the gold or kill the Wumpus.
